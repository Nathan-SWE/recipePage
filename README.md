# Recipe Page

This project was built as part of a [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm), with the goal of recreating a recipe page as closely as possible to the provided design.

The main focus was to practice development using React, applying core concepts such as componentization, code reusability, and building a clean, responsive UI.
